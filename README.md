CS337 Project 1 -- Tweet Mining & The Golden Globes 

This project uses a variety of natural language processing (NLP) and text-processing libraries/packages for handling various text-related tasks. The following libraries/packages are included in the project:

## Libraries/Packages Overview

1. **Unidecode**: Converts Unicode text (e.g., accented characters) into ASCII text, useful for simplifying text handling.
   
2. **SpaCy**: A powerful NLP library for advanced text processing such as tokenization, lemmatization, named entity recognition, etc.
    - Model: `en_core_web_sm` (Small English model for NLP tasks).
      
3. **VADER Sentiment Analysis**: VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media, and works well on texts from other domains.
   
4. **FTFY**: Fixes text encoding issues, like repairing mojibake (encoding errors), and ensures proper display of text.
   
5. **FuzzyWuzzy** is a Python library which is used for string matching. Fuzzy string matching is the process of finding strings that match a given pattern.
   
6.  **tqdm** is a Python library that provides a fast, extensible progress bar for loops and iterables, making it easy to visualize the progress of your code.
   
7. **NLTK**: The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a comprehensive library for working with human language data (text) in Python, including text classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and more.


## Setup Instructions

The setup process automates the creation of a Conda environment, installs and downloads the required libraries from a `environment.yml` file.
